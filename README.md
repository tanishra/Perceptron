# 🧠 Perceptron from Scratch on Iris Dataset

This project showcases the implementation of a **custom Perceptron algorithm from scratch** in Python using **NumPy**, and compares it with the **scikit-learn Perceptron** — all within a single Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠 What’s Inside

- ✅ Custom implementation of the Perceptron algorithm
- 🔁 Training the model using a basic weight update rule
- 🧪 Predictions and accuracy evaluation
- 📦 Comparison with `sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron`
- 📊 Optional visualizations

---

## Requirements

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional for plotting)
- notebook (to run the .ipynb file)
